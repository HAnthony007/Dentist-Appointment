# React + Vite + Bun

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.36. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
